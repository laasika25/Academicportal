## Introduction

The **ML Model for Academic Purposes** chatbot is designed to provide real-time answers to students’ frequently asked academic questions. This project uses Sentence-BERT embeddings and cosine similarity to deliver the most relevant answer to a user's query.

## ✨ Features

- **NLP-Powered**: Understands academic questions through Sentence-BERT embeddings.
- **High Precision Matching**: Finds the best answer using cosine similarity.
- **User-Friendly UI**: Responsive web interface with Flask and HTML/CSS.
- **Error Handling**: Friendly messages when something goes wrong.

Sentence-BERT (all-MiniLM-L6-v2): Embeds student queries and compares them with each question in the dataset.
Cosine Similarity: Measures similarity between the user query and dataset queries to find the best answer.
Flask Backend: Routes user queries to the model and returns the results.

💻 **Technologies Used**
Python: Core programming language.
Pandas: Data processing.
Sentence-Transformers: For Sentence-BERT embeddings.
Flask: Web app framework.
HTML/CSS: Frontend development.

🔮 **Future Work**
Improve Accuracy: Test other models to enhance response accuracy.
New Features: Add voice input, multilingual support, etc.
Deployment: Make the chatbot publicly accessible for educational use.
